# Rock-Paper-Scissors
You may have played rock paper scissors before. Maybe you’ve used it to decide who pays for dinner or who gets first choice of players for a team.
If you’re unfamiliar, rock paper scissors is hand game for two or more players. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended).


The rules are straightforward:


●	Rock smashes scissors.


●	Paper covers rock.


●	Scissors cut paper.


Now that you have the rules down, you can start thinking about how they might translate to Python code. 


INTRODUCTION:


Rock-paper-scissors is a classic hand game that has been played for generations. The game is simple: two players each make a fist with one hand, then simultaneously reveal their choice of rock, paper, or scissors by extending their fingers.

SYSTEM STUDY:


Rock beats scissors (by breaking them), scissors beat paper (by cutting it), and paper beats rock (by covering it). If both players make the same choice, it's a tie.

In recent years, the game has become popular as a simple programming exercise to create a computer opponent. The goal of the project is to create a program that can play rock-paper-scissors against a human opponent.

The program will take input from the user, either "rock", "paper", or "scissors", and then generate a random choice of its own. The program will then compare the choices and declare a winner or a tie.

The project can be extended in various ways, such as adding a scoring system, creating a graphical user interface, or adding more complex AI to the computer opponent. Overall, the rock-paper-scissors project is a fun and engaging way to practice programming skills and explore basic game theory concepts.
Requirements gathering: Identify the project's requirements by speaking with the stakeholders and reviewing the project brief. This step involves understanding the project's scope, goals, and limitations.

Design: Develop a design for the project, including the user interface, data structures, and algorithms. In this step, you would determine how the game would work, how players would select their moves, how the computer would select its moves, and how the game's logic would be implemented.

Implementation: Develop the project according to the design, using the Python programming language. This step involves writing the code for the game, testing it to ensure it works correctly, and debugging any errors.

Testing: Test the game to ensure that it meets the project requirements and works as expected. This step involves playing the game multiple times, trying different moves, and testing edge cases to ensure that the game is robust.

Documentation: Write documentation for the project, including a user manual, technical documentation, and any other required documentation. This step is essential to ensure that the project can be maintained and improved upon in the future.

Deployment: Deploy the project, making it available for use by end-users. This step involves packaging the project, distributing it to the appropriate platforms, and making it available for download or online play.

Maintenance: Provide ongoing maintenance and support for the project, including bug fixes, updates, and user support. This step ensures that the project remains functional and useful over time.

Overall, a system study on rock paper scissors for a Python course project would involve a comprehensive approach that covers all aspects of the project's development, from requirements gathering to maintenance and support. By following these steps, you can develop a high-quality, functional game that meets the needs of the project's stakeholders and users.
